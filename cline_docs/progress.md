# Progress

## Current Project Status

### What Works
- **Basic Authentication**: Okta SSO integration configured
- **Core Framework**: Blazor WebAssembly client with .NET 8.0 backend structure
- **Database Connection**: MongoDB Atlas connectivity established (production DB used in development)
- **Project Structure**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Basic UI Framework**: Responsive layout structure with navigation
- **Docker Setup**: Containerization configured for deployment
- **Data Models**: Core models like Manager, Standings, Draft, etc. defined
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup functional with production data access

### Current Focus: Commish Tab
**Priority 1**: Getting the Commissioner interface fully functional
- **Location**: `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/` directory
- **Components**: Multiple Commish-related Razor components already exist
- **Status**: Currently under active development and troubleshooting

### Immediate Next Goal: Season Data Visualization
**Priority 2**: Enhanced season data display using existing MongoDB data
- **Objective**: Display detailed information about each season
- **Key Feature**: Charts/graphs showing standings over time
- **Data Source**: Historical season data already stored in MongoDB
- **Scope**: Leverage existing data for rich visualizations and analytics

### Infrastructure Status
- **Database Strategy**: Production MongoDB used in development for testing
- **Data Recreation**: Can easily recreate data if needed during development
- **Hosting**: Digital Ocean deployment pipeline established
- **SSL/Security**: Basic security measures in place

## Active Development Workflow

### Current Development Areas
- **Commish Interface**: Debugging and completing commissioner functionality
- **Data Visualization**: Planning charts/graphs for season standings
- **MongoDB Integration**: Utilizing existing season data effectively
- **UI Components**: Refining Razor components for data display

### Development Environment Notes
- **Database**: Production MongoDB connection in development environment
