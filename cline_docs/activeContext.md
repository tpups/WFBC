# Active Context

## Current Status
This is a fresh memory bank initialization for the World Fantasy Baseball Classic (WFBC) project. No active development tasks are currently in progress.

## What I'm Working On Now
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Building comprehensive documentation for the existing WFBC project
- **Project Understanding**: Analyzing the current state of the application based on file structure and wiki documentation

## Recent Changes
1. **Memory Bank Initialization** (Current Session)
   - Created cline_docs directory structure
   - Built productContext.md with comprehensive project overview
   - Reviewed all wiki documentation for accurate context

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank creation with remaining files:
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md  
   - progress.md
2. Verify memory bank completeness
3. Await user direction for next development tasks

## Key Files Currently Open
- `cline_docs/productContext.md` - Project purpose and context
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Commish.razor` - Commissioner interface
- `wfbc.page/Shared/Models/Manager.cs` - Manager data model
- `wfbc.page/Shared/Models/Standings.cs` - Standings data model
- `wfbc.page/Client/Shared/NavMenu.razor` - Navigation component

## Current Understanding
The project is a mature fantasy baseball league management system with:
- Multi-year historical data (2011-present)
- Role-based access control (Commish vs Managers)
- MongoDB data persistence
- Okta SSO authentication
- Docker containerization
- Digital Ocean hosting

## Pending Questions/Clarifications
None at this time - memory bank creation is the current focus.
