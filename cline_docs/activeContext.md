# Active Context

## Recently Completed Task
**JSON Deserialization Error Fix**: Successfully resolved the "The input does not contain any JSON tokens" error when creating drafts and teams in the WFBC Commissioner interface.

## What Was Fixed
- **Primary Issue**: JSON deserialization errors when creating drafts and teams
- **Root Cause**: Okta authorization issuer validation failure due to misconfigured `AuthorizationServerId`
- **Secondary Issues**: Null ManagerId causing API errors, and some unnecessary debugging code

## Key Technical Findings

### **Root Cause & Primary Fix**
The real issue was an **Okta issuer validation failure**:
- **Problem**: Server user secrets had `Okta:AuthorizationServerId = https://login.wfbc.page/oauth2/default` (full URL)
- **Solution**: Changed to `Okta:AuthorizationServerId = default` (just the ID)
- **Impact**: Server now properly validates tokens issued by `https://login.wfbc.page/oauth2/default`

### **Supporting Fixes Applied**
1. **AddEditTeam.razor.cs**: Added null check for `team.ManagerId` to prevent invalid API calls
2. **AddEditDraft.razor.cs**: Cleaned up unused imports and maintained proper error handling
3. **Startup.cs**: Added CORS configuration for Blazor WebAssembly with authorization

### **Debugging Code Removed During Cleanup**
- **GroupsClaimsTransformation.cs**: Deleted entire file (not needed)
- **Claims transformation registration**: Removed from Startup.cs (Okta handles this correctly)
- **AuthorizationMessageHandler scopes**: Removed unnecessary explicit scopes (defaults work)
- **Various unused imports**: Cleaned up across multiple files

## Current Status
- ✅ **Team Creation**: Fully functional with proper authorization
- ✅ **Draft Creation**: Fully functional with proper authorization (creates draft + all pick records)
- ✅ **Authorization**: All endpoints properly secured with clean Okta configuration
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with specific status codes
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean, minimal, maintainable solution

## Key Files Modified
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/AddEditTeam.razor.cs` - Added null ManagerId check
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/AddEditDraft.razor.cs` - Cleaned imports, maintained error handling
- `wfbc.page/Server/Startup.cs` - Added CORS configuration, cleaned imports
- `wfbc.page/Client/Program.cs` - Cleaned AuthorizationMessageHandler configuration
- **Deleted**: `wfbc.page/Server/Models/GroupsClaimsTransformation.cs` (unnecessary)

## User Action Required (Completed)
The user needed to update their server user secrets:
```
Okta:AuthorizationServerId = "default"
```
This was the critical fix that resolved the authorization validation failure.

## Next Steps
The commissioner interface is now fully functional for:
- Creating and managing teams
- Creating drafts with automatic pick generation
- Managing league operations with proper authentication

The codebase is clean and optimized with proper error handling and security.
