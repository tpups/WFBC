# Active Context

## Current Task: Year-Specific Teams & Performance Optimization
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Successfully implemented year-specific team retrieval and major performance optimization!

## What We Accomplished
**✅ Successfully implemented Year-Specific Team Retrieval** - The standings calculator now uses correct teams from year-specific databases (e.g., `wfbc2023.teams` for 2023 calculations) instead of application teams, ensuring accurate calculations with proper team data.

**✅ Successfully implemented Major Performance Optimization** - Transformed calculation from O(n²) to O(n) complexity using "load once, process incrementally" approach, achieving "lightning fast" performance that matches Python script efficiency.

**✅ Previously Completed: Standings Persistence & Pre-Calculation Checking MVP** - The system automatically saves calculated standings to the database and checks for existing data before starting new calculations, providing users with confirmation dialogs when standings already exist with "last updated" timestamps.

## Previous Accomplishments
**✅ Season Date Range Implementation**: Successfully implemented Season Date Range functionality for the rotisserie standings calculator. The system now processes standings only for configured season dates (March 1 - October 31 by default) instead of the entire calendar year, providing ~33% faster calculations and more accurate seasonal data.

**✅ Complete SignalR Real-Time Progress System**: Successfully replaced Python scripts with a comprehensive C# solution that includes real-time progress reporting during rotisserie standings calculation, allowing users to see actual dates being processed (e.g., "Processing standings for 2023-01-15...") in real-time during the long-running daily calculations (365+ days per season).

## Season Date Range Implementation - COMPLETED

## Current Working Implementation

### **Season Date Configuration Flow**
Users can now:
1. Navigate to Commish → Standings
2. Select a year from the dropdown
3. Click "Edit Season Dates" to modify the date range
4. Set custom start/end dates (defaults to March 1 - October 31)
5. Save settings to the database

### **Enhanced Calculation Flow**
When building standings:
1. System automatically loads season settings for the selected year
2. If no settings exist, creates defaults (March 1 - October 31)
3. Processes only the configured date range instead of full calendar year
4. Shows real-time progress: "Processing standings for 2023-03-15..." etc.
5. Displays completion message with actual date range processed

### **Robust Cancellation Flow**
Users can cancel long-running calculations:
1. Click "Cancel Calculation" during processing
2. Client calls `/api/RotisserieStandings/cancel/{progressGroupId}`
3. Server immediately stops processing using cancellation tokens
4. Background task terminates gracefully with proper cleanup
5. User receives immediate feedback about cancellation

### **Technical Architecture**
- **MongoDB Integration**: SeasonSettings collection with proper BSON attributes
- **Authorization**: Okta-based with Commissioner role protection on all endpoints
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR integration for progress updates and cancellation
- **Cancellation Tokens**: Proper .NET async/await patterns with CancellationToken support

### ✅ **Major Performance Optimization Complete**
7. **Load Once, Process Incrementally**: Transformed from O(n²) to O(n) complexity
   - **Old Approach**: ~240 database queries (one per day, each growing larger)
   - **New Approach**: 3 database queries total (hitting, pitching, quality appearances)
   - **Result**: "Lightning fast" performance matching Python script efficiency

8. **New Performance Methods**:
   - `LoadAllSeasonBoxScores()` - Loads entire season data in single operation
   - `ProcessIncrementalStandings()` - Processes daily data using pre-loaded datasets
   - `ProcessDaily*Data()` methods - Add daily deltas to running totals
   - `SeasonBoxScoreData` class - Efficient data structure with date-grouped collections

9. **Optimized Data Flow**:
   - Load all hitting box scores for season (one query)
   - Load all pitching box scores for season (one query)  
   - Load all quality appearance data for season (one query)
   - Group by date for efficient daily processing
   - Maintain running totals in memory
   - Process each day by adding deltas to running totals

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Accurate Team Data**: Now uses correct teams from year-specific databases
- **Blazing Performance**: Calculation time reduced from slow to "lightning fast"
- **Same Results**: All optimizations maintain identical calculation accuracy
- **Real-time Progress**: Still shows progress updates during faster calculations
- **All Features Intact**: Persistence, cancellation, and pre-checks still work perfectly

### **Technical Architecture Achievements**
- **Correct Data Sources**: Uses `wfbc{year}.teams` instead of `wfbc.teams`
- **Optimal Performance**: From exponential to linear time complexity
- **Memory Efficient**: Loads data once, processes incrementally
- **Maintained Accuracy**: Identical results to previous slower approach
- **Future Proof**: Architecture supports easy addition of more optimizations

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- Optional: Additional validation for season date ranges
- Optional: Bulk season settings management for multiple years
- Optional: Further performance optimizations (database indexes, parallel processing)
- Future: UI/UX improvements and styling consistency across other components

## Developer Notes
- **Debugger Behavior**: TaskCanceledException visible in debugger during cancellation is normal .NET behavior and indicates proper operation
- **Exception Handling**: Uses standard .NET cancellation token patterns with proper OperationCanceledException handling
- **Performance**: Season date limitation + database persistence provides significant performance improvement for large datasets
- **Design Consistency**: Modal component follows existing application patterns using Modal.razor structure
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports easy addition of other configurable settings and data persistence features
- **MVP Status**: Core functionality complete and working, with room for future styling and UX improvements
