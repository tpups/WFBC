# Active Context

## Current Task: Season Date Range Implementation
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Successfully implemented and working!

## What We Accomplished
**✅ Successfully implemented Season Date Range functionality** for the rotisserie standings calculator. The system now processes standings only for configured season dates (March 1 - October 31 by default) instead of the entire calendar year, providing ~33% faster calculations and more accurate seasonal data.

## Previous Accomplishment
**✅ Complete SignalR Real-Time Progress System**: Successfully replaced Python scripts with a comprehensive C# solution that includes real-time progress reporting during rotisserie standings calculation, allowing users to see actual dates being processed (e.g., "Processing standings for 2023-01-15...") in real-time during the long-running daily calculations (365+ days per season).

## Season Date Range Implementation - COMPLETED

### ✅ **Database & Backend Infrastructure Complete**
1. **SeasonSettings Model**: Created `wfbc.page/Shared/Models/SeasonSettings.cs` with MongoDB attributes for storing season start/end dates
2. **Database Collection**: Added 'settings' collection to WfbcDBContext
3. **Data Access Layer**: Created `wfbc.page/Server/DataAccess/SeasonSettingsDataAccessLayer.cs` with full CRUD operations
4. **API Controller**: Created `wfbc.page/Server/Controllers/SeasonSettingsController.cs` with RESTful endpoints and Commissioner authorization
5. **Service Integration**: Updated `wfbc.page/Server/Services/RotisserieStandingsService.cs` to use configured date ranges
6. **Dependency Injection**: Registered ISeasonSettings service in Startup.cs

### ✅ **User Interface Complete**
7. **Season Settings Panel**: Added fully functional UI to `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Standings.razor` with:
   - Year selector (current year ± 5 years)
   - Date picker inputs for season start/end dates
   - Edit/Cancel functionality with save confirmation
   - Error handling and success messaging
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS styling
8. **Component Integration**: Updated `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Standings.razor.cs` with season settings management

### ✅ **Enhanced Standings Processing Complete**
9. **Configurable Date Range**: Standings calculation now uses season settings instead of full calendar year
10. **Default Settings**: Automatically creates March 1 - October 31 defaults when no settings exist
11. **Real-time Progress**: Updated progress messages show actual date range being processed
12. **Improved Efficiency**: ~33% faster calculations (245 vs 365 days)

### ✅ **Server-Side Cancellation System Complete**
13. **Cancellation Token Management**: Added `ConcurrentDictionary` to track active calculations with unique IDs
14. **Cancel API Endpoint**: Created `/api/RotisserieStandings/cancel/{progressGroupId}` endpoint
15. **Background Task Integration**: Proper OperationCanceledException handling in controller
16. **Service-Level Cancellation**: Added cancellation token checks before each day's processing
17. **Exception Handling**: Clean handling of both TaskCanceledException and OperationCanceledException
18. **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper disposal of cancellation tokens when complete

### ✅ **Client-Side Cancellation Features Complete**
19. **Progress Group Tracking**: Store calculation ID for cancellation in `BuildUpdateStandingsModel`
20. **Cancel Calculation Method**: Client-side method calls server-side cancel endpoint
21. **Dynamic UI**: Different buttons shown when calculating vs idle state
22. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate response to cancellation requests
23. **State Management**: Proper UI state synchronization

### ✅ **Critical Bug Fixes Applied**
24. **Stack Overflow**: Fixed field-level initialization causing circular references by moving to OnInitializedAsync()
25. **JSON Parsing Errors**: Added content validation before JSON parsing for missing settings
26. **EditForm Errors**: Added formModel object to satisfy EditForm requirements
27. **Build Errors**: Fixed duplicate catch blocks and inheritance conflicts
28. **Exception Handling**: Unified cancellation exception handling for clean operation

## Current Working Implementation

### **Season Date Configuration Flow**
Users can now:
1. Navigate to Commish → Standings
2. Select a year from the dropdown
3. Click "Edit Season Dates" to modify the date range
4. Set custom start/end dates (defaults to March 1 - October 31)
5. Save settings to the database

### **Enhanced Calculation Flow**
When building standings:
1. System automatically loads season settings for the selected year
2. If no settings exist, creates defaults (March 1 - October 31)
3. Processes only the configured date range instead of full calendar year
4. Shows real-time progress: "Processing standings for 2023-03-15..." etc.
5. Displays completion message with actual date range processed

### **Robust Cancellation Flow**
Users can cancel long-running calculations:
1. Click "Cancel Calculation" during processing
2. Client calls `/api/RotisserieStandings/cancel/{progressGroupId}`
3. Server immediately stops processing using cancellation tokens
4. Background task terminates gracefully with proper cleanup
5. User receives immediate feedback about cancellation

### **Technical Architecture**
- **MongoDB Integration**: SeasonSettings collection with proper BSON attributes
- **Authorization**: Okta-based with Commissioner role protection on all endpoints
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR integration for progress updates and cancellation
- **Cancellation Tokens**: Proper .NET async/await patterns with CancellationToken support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: ~33% improvement in processing time due to reduced date range

## Modified Files Summary

### **New Files Created**
- ✅ `wfbc.page/Shared/Models/SeasonSettings.cs` - Season date range model
- ✅ `wfbc.page/Server/Interface/ISeasonSettings.cs` - Data access interface

## User Benefits Achieved
- **Faster Processing**: ~33% reduction in calculation time (245 vs 365 days)
- **Season Accuracy**: Only processes relevant baseball season dates
- **User Control**: Commissioners can customize season ranges per year and cancel operations
- **Professional UX**: Intuitive interface with proper state management
- **System Reliability**: Robust error handling and cancellation support

## Next Steps (If Needed)
- Data persistence implementation for calculated standings (placeholder `SaveStandingToDatabase` exists)
- Optional: Additional validation for season date ranges
- Optional: Bulk season settings management for multiple years

## Developer Notes
- **Debugger Behavior**: TaskCanceledException visible in debugger during cancellation is normal .NET behavior and indicates proper operation
- **Exception Handling**: Uses standard .NET cancellation token patterns with proper OperationCanceledException handling
- **Performance**: Season date limitation provides significant performance improvement for large datasets
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports easy addition of other configurable settings in the future
