# Active Context

## Current Status
Successfully completed fixing all Commish tab button stack overflow issues by resolving circular reference problems in component inheritance.

## What I'm Working On Now
- **Commish Tab Fixes**: âœ… COMPLETED - Fixed all circular reference issues causing stack overflow
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Updating documentation to reflect recent work and fixes

## Recent Changes
1. **Memory Bank Initialization** (Session Start)
   - Created comprehensive cline_docs directory structure
   - Built all required memory bank files with accurate project context

2. **Commish Tab Circular Reference Fixes** (Main Work)
   - **Teams Button**: Fixed `TeamsModel` inheritance from `CommishModel` â†’ `ComponentBase`
   - **Drafts Button**: Fixed `DraftsModel` inheritance from `CommishModel` â†’ `ComponentBase`  
   - **Managers Button**: Fixed `ManagersModel` inheritance from `CommishModel` â†’ `ComponentBase`
   - **Standings Button**: Fixed `StandingsModel` inheritance from `CommishModel` â†’ `ComponentBase`

3. **Technical Implementation Details**:
   - Applied consistent pattern: break `CommishModel` inheritance, add direct dependency injection
   - Added required properties and methods to each component (`managers`, `teams`, `drafts`, `standings`)
   - Updated initialization methods from `OnInitialized()` to `OnInitializedAsync()`
   - Resolved dependent component issues (`AddEditTeam`, `BuildUpdateStandings`)

## Next Steps
1. âœ… **Complete Commish Tab**: All four main buttons (Teams, Drafts, Managers, Standings) now working
2. **Data Visualization**: Next major goal - implement charts/graphs for season standings over time
3. **Season Data Display**: Enhanced season information views using existing MongoDB data

## Key Files Modified
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Teams.razor.cs` - Removed CommishModel inheritance
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Teams.razor` - Updated async initialization
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Drafts.razor.cs` - Removed CommishModel inheritance
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Managers.razor.cs` - Removed CommishModel inheritance
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Managers.razor` - Updated async initialization
- `wfbc.page/Client/Pages/Commish/Standings.razor.cs` - Removed CommishModel inheritance

## Current Understanding
The WFBC project has solid foundations with the Commish interface now fully functional:
- âœ… Commissioner authentication and authorization working
- âœ… All Commish tab navigation working (Teams, Drafts, Managers, Standings)
- âœ… CRUD operations available for league management
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next Focus**: Season data visualization with charts/graphs
- ðŸ“Š **Data Ready**: Historical season data available in MongoDB for visualization

## Technical Approach Used
**Circular Reference Resolution Pattern**:
1. Identify components inheriting from `CommishModel`
2. Change inheritance to `ComponentBase`
3. Add direct dependency injection (`AuthorizedClient`, `PublicClient`, `NavigationManager`)
4. Add required data properties and loading methods
5. Update initialization to async pattern
6. Test and verify functionality

## Success Metrics
- âœ… Build succeeds with no errors
- âœ… All Commish buttons work without stack overflow
- âœ… League management operations functional
