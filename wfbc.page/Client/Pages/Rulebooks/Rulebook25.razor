    @*Stats and Rankings*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2">1. Stats and Rankings</h2>
    <p>
        The World Fantasy Baseball Classic is a rotisserie style fantasy baseball league. Teams accumulate stats in the categories listed below throughout the entirety of the Major League Baseball regular season.
    </p>
    <p>
        All stats are provided and updated by RotoWire MLB Commissioner Service. League standings are calculated by RotoWire. Statistical categories are as follows:
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-lg indent-4">Hitting</h4>
    <ul class="indent-4">
        <li>Batting Average (AVG)</li>
        <li>Home Runs (HR)</li>
        <li>Runs Batted In (RBI)</li>
        <li>Stolen Bases (SB)</li>
        <li>Runs Scored (R)</li>
        <li>On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-lg indent-4">Pitching</h4>
    <ul class="indent-4 pb-1">
        <li>Earned Run Average (ERA)</li>
        <li>Quality Starts (QS)</li>
        <li>Walks plus Hits per Inning Pitched (WHIP)</li>
        <li>Saves (S)</li>
        <li>Strikeouts (K)</li>
        <li>Innings Pitched (IP)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Counting stats such as Home Runs and Quality Starts will reward teams that accumulate the most of a given stat over the course of the season. Rate stats such as OPS and Batting Average reward teams that maintain the highest rate, while ERA and WHIP reward teams that maintain the lowest rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams can score between 1 and 12 points in each statistical category. The team with the highest point total at the end of the regular season will be named WFBC League Champion.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event of a tie the winner will be the team with 12 points in the most categories. If the tie still cannot be broken, the winner will be the team with the most top-2 category finishes. This process will continue until the tie is broken. If it is impossible to break the tie using this method the league will name co-champions and the two teams will split the 1st and 2nd place payouts.
    </p>
    <p>
        WFBC seasons are limited to 162 games and shall not consider regular season tie-breaking games for the purposes of WFBC stats and rankings.
    </p>

    @*Roster Composition*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">2. Roster Composition</h2>
    <p>
        Each team may roster up to 35 players between the preseason Draft and the end of the season. There is no limit on roster size during the offseason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Up to 15 players on the roster can be in the starting lineup. Teams must fill starting lineup spots if an eligible player is on their roster. This requirement will be monitored by other managers in the league and violations reported to the commissioner. Repeat offenders will be subject to loss of draft picks at the commissioner's discretion. Starting lineup positions are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="indent-4 pb-1">
        <li>(1) Catcher</li>
        <li>(1) First Baseman</li>
        <li>(1) Second Baseman</li>
        <li>(1) Third Baseman</li>
        <li>(1) Shortstop</li>
        <li>(3) Outfielders</li>
        <li>(1) Utility Player</li>
        <li>(6) Pitchers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The remaining 20 bench spots can be allocated with no restrictions on positions.</p>
    <p>
        Players will be eligible at a position if they have appeared there in at least 10 games during the current or previous regular season. Position eligibility is determined by RotoWire. Any hitter is eligible to fill the Utility Player role. Pitchers are not subject to the 10-game requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Minor league or foreign league seasons will be used to determine eligibility of players entering the Major Leagues for the first time, following the same 10-game rule. Any season after their initial MLB appearance will only consider players' Major League games when determining position eligibility. Contact the commissioner to insert a first-year player into your lineup if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players such as Shoehei Ohtani who are listed as both hitters and pitchers will only count as a single player toward the roster limit. The hitter and pitcher versions of these players must always be on the same team.
    </p>

    @*Drafts*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">3. Drafts</h2>
    <p>
        The WFBC will hold the following drafts each season. The drafts and subsequent Free Agency periods will be the only times teams are permitted to add players from the Free Agent pool.
    </p>
    <ul class="indent-4 pb-1">
        <li><strong>Preseason (PS) Draft</strong></li>
        <li>
            <strong>Competitive Balance Draft</strong>
            <br>○ Each team will receive one pick. The CBD draft order will be the reverse of the standings once games have ended on the day prior to the CBD. Competitive Balance Draft picks cannot be traded
        </li>
        <li><strong>Midseason (MS) Draft</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To be eligible to participate in drafts teams must have fewer than 35 players. Teams must release players from their current roster by the drop date which will be specified by the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
        The preseason draft order will be based on the previous season's finish. The midseason draft order will be based on current season standings. The owner in last place will have the first pick, followed by the owner in second-to-last, and so on. The draft order will repeat itself in all subsequent rounds. The draft will continue until each owner has filled all of their available roster spots, or no owner chooses to make another selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Free Agency period will begin following the last pick of the preseason and midseason drafts. The commissioner will determine the length of Free Agency. There will be no Free Agency following the Competitive Balance Draft.
    </p>
    <p>
        All preseason and midseason draft picks can be traded.
    </p>

    @*Team & Roster Management*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">4. Team & Roster Management</h2>
    <p>
        Teams will manage their own rosters on Rotowire's website. Rosters are set weekly and lock at the scheduled start of the first game on Monday. Players cannot be moved in or out of a lineup midweek unless one of the following conditions are met.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Midweek Exceptions</strong> - contact the commissioner to make a lineup move midweek if one of the following applies:</p>
    <ul class="indent-4 pb-1">
        <li><strong>Injured List, Bereavement List, Paternity List</strong> — A player in the starting lineup is officially placed on any MLB team's Injured List, Bereavement List, or Paternity List
            <br>○ Players on the Bereavement List or Paternity List are eligible to be re-inserted into the starting lineup if they return the same week they were placed on the list and removed from the starting lineup. Players who did not start that week in the starting lineup are not eligible to be inserted into the starting lineup when returning from bereavement or paternity leave (unless a different midweek exception were to apply).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Suspension</strong> - A player in the starting lineup is officially suspended or placed on administrative leave by MLB</li>
        <li><strong>Starting Player Trade</strong> — If a player currently in a team's starting lineup is traded midweek the empty starting roster spot can be filled from the owner's bench. In the event a trade opens a starting roster position that another player in the starting lineup is eligible for, teams will be permitted to shift the starting player into the open spot and fill the resulting open position from the bench. If an owner receives a player in a trade midweek, but did not trade one of their starting players, the player the owner receives will not be eligible for immediate insertion into the lineup. Once a pitcher has accumulated stats in any given week, their lineup slot is not eligible for this midweek exception if they are traded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For all list placements and suspensions, a player only becomes eligible for a midweek exception once the MLB team has officially submitted the player's name to the respective list. The list placement must appear on the WFBC Rotowire team page or MLB.com. If games have started by the time the request is made, the lineup move will take effect the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players may be dropped from a team's roster at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trades, adds, and drops will be performed by the league commissioner. Managers have control over weekly lineup changes, but not personnel moves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Team names must be finalized by April 15. Teams are limited to one name per season and names will be manually changed back if this requirement is not met. Frequent name changes may result in additional penalties such as loss of draft picks.
    </p>

    @*Trades*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">5. Trades</h2>
    <p>
        Teams may trade players and draft picks any time other than during the final week of the season. All trades during the season must be completed by 9pm (PST) one week before the end of the regular season. Trades may resume after the final game of the regular season.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams may only trade draft picks from the next four preseason or midseason drafts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a roster size limit is in effect, trades will not be processed until all teams have submitted drops to stay within the limit.
    </p>

    @*Decision Making*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">6. Decision Making</h2>
    <p>
        Major rule changes will be pushed to a league vote. Rule changes will need a simple majority to pass. Language changes made in order to clarify an already established rule will not require a league vote. If for any reason the commissioner chooses to veto a rule change, they will have the right to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a ruling needs to be made on an item that is not outlined in this rulebook the commissioner will be tasked with resolving the issue and has final decision-making power.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Fun Clause</strong> - Not every situation that can come up has been outlined in these rules and as such at times decisions will need to be made in real time to address a unique scenario. It is the commissioners commitment and responsibility to always make the most fun version of a decision to address the scenario.
    </p>

    @*Dynasty Rules*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">7. Dynasty Rules</h2>
    <p>
        There is no limit to the number of years an owner can control a player. Full rosters will be carried over year to year, except in cases of league expansion.
    </p>

    @*League Reset Timeframe*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">8. League Reset Timeframe</h2>
    <p>
        WFBC members voted to reset the league prior to the 2025 WFBC season. WFBC members can not vote to reset again until the 2039-2040 offseason at the earliest. This rule can only be changed by unanimous consent of all league members.
    </p>

    @*League Fees*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">9. League Fees</h2>
    <p>
        WFBC fees for the 2025 season are $200 per team. This provides $2400 to be submitted to the Designated Owner as defined in Invest The Funds (Section 10)
    </p>

    @*Invest The Funds*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">10. Invest The Funds</h2>
    <p>
        All entry fees will be submitted as funds to a Designated Owner for them to "invest" over the course of the WFBC season. All investment decisions are the sole responsibility of the Designated Owner. The Designated Owner agrees to not be a dick and spend the funds on anything other than the chosen investments.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the 2025 season, the Designated owner is Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
        No later than 1 week after the end of the World Series, the Designated Owner will return all remaining post-tax invested funds to the commissioner. If all funds are lost while invested, the Designated Owner is not responsible for returning money. All returned funds will be distributed per Payouts (Section 11)
    </p>

    @*Payouts*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">11. Payouts</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to Invest The Funds, the winnings were distributed as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>$1200 (54.55%) - First Place</li>
        <li>$600 (27.27%) - Second Place</li>
        <li>$400 (18.18%) - Third Place</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All returned funds from Invest The Funds (Section 10) will be distributed as payouts using the same percentages as the 2023 payouts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>54.55% - First Place</li>
        <li>27.27% - Second Place</li>
        <li>18.18% - Third Place</li>
    </ul>
