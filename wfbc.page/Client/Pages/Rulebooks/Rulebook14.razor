    @*Stats and Rankings*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">2 - Stats and Rankings</h2>
    <p>
        Stats are provided by Rotowire. Team stats are updated live on Rotowire and League stats and rankings will update at the end of each day.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Statistical categories are as follows:</h3>
    <h4 class="text-lg indent-4">Offensive</h4>
    <ol class="indent-4">
        <li>Batting Average</li>
        <li>Home Runs</li>
        <li>RBI</li>
        <li>Stolen Bases</li>
        <li>Runs Scored</li>
        <li>OPS</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="text-lg indent-4">Defensive</h4>
    <ol class="indent-4 pb-1">
        <li>ERA</li>
        <li>Quality Starts</li>
        <li>WHIP</li>
        <li>Saves</li>
        <li>Strikeouts</li>
        <li>Innings Pitched</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The WFBC is a rotisserie style league and as such owners will accumulate stats in the previously listed categories throughout the entirety of the Major League Baseball regular season. Counting stats such as Home Runs and Quality Starts will reward owners that accumulate the most of a given stat over the course of the season. Rate stats such as OPS and Batting Average reward owners that maintain the highest rate, while ERA and WHIP reward owners that maintain the lowest rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each stat category has a maximum point value of 10 and a minimum point value of 1. As such the maximum score an owner can achieve is 120 and the minimum is 12. The owner with the highest point total at the end of the regular season will be named WFBC League Champion. In the event of a tie the winner will be the tied owner with the highest number of statistical categories in which they placed 1st. If the tie can still not be broken, the winner will be the owner with the highest number of statistical categories in which they finished 1st or 2nd. This process will continue until the tie is broken. If it is impossible to break the tie using this method the league will name co-champions and the two owners will split the 1st and 2nd place payouts.
    </p>
    <p>
        WFBC seasons are limited to 162 games and shall not consider regular season tie-breaking games for the purposes of WFBC stats and rankings.
    </p>

    @*Roster Composition*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">3 - Roster Composition</h2>
    <p>
        Each team consists of 40 roster spots. An owner can choose to roster less than 40 players, but may never have more than 40. Up to 15 of the 40 players on the roster will be in the starting lineup.
    </p>
    <p>Starting lineups will be composed as follows:</p>
    <ol class="indent-4 pb-1">
        <li>Infielders (1B, 2B, SS, and 3B)</li>
        <li>Outfielders (3)</li>
        <li>Catcher</li>
        <li>Utility Player</li>
        <li>Pitchers (6)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The remaining 25 bench spots can be allocated with no restrictions on positions.</p>
    <p>
        Eligibility at a position is granted after 10 appearances in a particular position. Players will carry position eligibility from the current season as well as the previous season. The first draft of a new season will use the number of games played by a player in any particular position from the previous year. After the season starts, a player must complete 10 games in a position outside of his original position to be eligible at the new position. This results in a player that is eligible in multiple positions. Players entering the Major League for the first time will only have their Major League service time considered in determining position eligibility. As a general rule the league will default to Rotowire's position eligibility which can only be overruled at the commissioner's discretion.
    </p>

    @*Draft*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">4 - Draft</h2>
    <p>
        Each WFBC season will consist of at least two drafts. There will always be a Preseason and Midseason draft. In certain cases there will be a Competitive Balance draft added as a third draft. The Competitive Balance draft will occur if any team is averaging less than 4 points per stat category (fewer than 48 points) on May 15th at 12:01 am. Only teams with fewer than the 4 point average will be eligible to draft. The draft will be limited to 2 picks per eligible team. Competitive Balance picks are not eligible to be traded. The Competitive Balance draft will take place no earlier than May 15th and no later than May 20th.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players can be selected from either the American or National league. Additionally, owners can draft players in the Minor Leagues, or those that are not yet attached to a professional team in the United States (ex. International or Youth Players).
    </p>
    <p>
        The draft order will be based on the previous season rankings. The owner finishing in last place will have the first pick in the following season's Preseason draft. The draft order will repeat itself in all subsequent rounds. The draft will continue until each owner has filled all of their available roster spots, or no owner chooses to make another selection. Owners have the ability to release players and replace them with players from the Free Agent pool until 9pm (PST) on the night before the first game. The same rule applies to the period of time between the Midseason draft and the night before the first game of the second half. All picks can be traded.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be eligible to participate in the draft an owner must release players from their current roster no later than 9pm (PST) the night before the draft. The commissioner will make the released player pool public once all owners have submitted their player lists.
    </p>

    @*Roster Management*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">5 - Roster Management</h2>
    <p>
        Owners will manage their own rosters from Rotowire's website. Roster moves can be made weekly and take effect each Monday. Changes must be submitted before the first game on Monday. Rosters will be locked throughout the week and players will not be moved in or out of a lineup midweek unless one of the following conditions are met.
    </p>
    <p>Midweek Exceptions:</p>
    <p>
        Injured Player — A player in the starting lineup is officially placed on the 7, 15, or 60 day DL. Exceptions will not be made for players on a paternity or bereavement list. A player only becomes eligible for a roster move once a team has officially submitted the player name to the DL.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting Player Trade — If a player currently being used in the starting lineup of an owner's roster is traded midweek the empty starting roster spot is able to be filled from the owner's bench. In the event that a trade opens a starting roster position that another starter on the same team is eligible for an owner will be permitted to shift another starter into that open spot and replace the resulting open spot from the bench. If an owner receives a player in a trade midweek, but did not trade one of their starting players, the player the owner receives will not be eligible for immediate insertion into the lineup.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players may be released from an owners roster at any time, but players may not be picked up from the Free Agent pool between drafts or in the baseball offseason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trades and player releases will be preformed by the league commissioner. Owners have control over lineup changes, but not personnel moves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Owners are limited to one team name in any particular WFBC season.
    </p>

    @*Trades*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">6 - Trades</h2>
    <p>
        All trades during the season must be completed by 9pm (PST) on August 31. Trades may resume after the final game of the regular season.
    </p>
    <p>
        No more than 2 draft picks can be included in one trade. Additionally, an owner may only trade rights to draft picks for a current season or the season immediately following the current season.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a player is eligible for multiple positions at the time of a trade, they will retain that status on the new team.
    </p>
    <p>
        Owners may take part in trades that involve uneven headcount. As an example, the league will allow an owner to trade a player in exchange for a draft pick, even if the owner that the player is being traded to currently has a full 40 man roster. In such a case the owner will be required to release enough players to keep their team to the 40 man limit before the trade can become official.
    </p>
    <p>See section 5 for more info on how trades relate to current roster management.</p>

    @*Decision Making*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">7 - Decision Making</h2>
    <p>
        Rule changes will be pushed to a league vote. Rule changes will need a simple majority to pass. Final decision making power in the WFBC lives with the commissioner. If for any reason the commissioner chooses to veto a rule change they will have the right to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a ruling needs to be made on an item that is not outlined in this rulebook the commissioner will be tasked with resolving the issue and has final decision making power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The commissioner can be changed in the offseason if owners choose to nominate a different owner. This decision will be made by league vote and will require 75% consensus.
    </p>

    @*Dynasty Rules*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">8 - Dynasty Rules</h2>
    <p>
        Full rosters will be carried over year to year (except in cases of league expansion). There is no limit to the number of years an owner can control a player.
    </p>

    @*League Expansion*@
    <h2 class="text-2xl pb-2 pt-4">9 - League Expansion</h2>
    <p>
        2014 WFBC league expansion will be conducted as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be two expansion teams. The expansion teams will participate in an Expansion Draft before the Preseason draft. The Expansion Draft will consist of 50 total picks (25 Rounds). Expansion owners will flip a coin for the right to the first pick. From that point on the draft will operate as a serpentine draft. Each round will consist of 1 pick from each new owner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Existing owners will have the option of protecting up to 7 players on their rosters before the expansion draft begins. After each round, owners will receive 3 additional player protections for each player that had been drafted from their team. No more than 8 players may be drafted from any given existing team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The expansion owner that picked 2nd in the Expansion draft will pick first in that season's Preseason draft. The owner that picked 1st in the Expansion draft will pick 2nd in the Preseason draft. Additionally, Expansion owners will be eligible for the Competitive Balance draft during their first season regardless of whether they meet the below 4 point average or not on May 15th.
    </p>
